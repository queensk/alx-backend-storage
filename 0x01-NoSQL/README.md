# 0x01. NoSQL
This repository contains code and examples related to NoSQL databases. NoSQL, which stands for "not only SQL," is a type of database management system that differs from traditional SQL-based relational databases. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and provide flexible data models and horizontal scalability.

## Learning Objectives
- What NoSQL means
- What is difference between SQL and NoSQL
- What is ACID
- What is a document storage
- What are NoSQL types
- What are benefits of a NoSQL database
- How to query information from a NoSQL database
- How to insert/update/delete information from a NoSQL database
- How to use MongoDB

## Introduction
In the world of modern applications, data comes in various forms and formats. NoSQL databases provide an alternative to the rigid structure of traditional SQL databases. They allow developers to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in flexible ways, accommodating dynamic and evolving data models.

This repository serves as a starting point for understanding and working with NoSQL databases. It provides code examples and explanations to help you grasp the concepts and apply them to your projects.

## Requirements
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using MongoDB (version 4.2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be a comment: // my comment
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
